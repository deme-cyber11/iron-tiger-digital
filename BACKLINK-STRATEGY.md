## Phase 3: Business Directories (Week 3-4)

### High-Priority Free Listings
Create consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) profiles on:

| Directory | DA | Priority | URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Business Profile | 100 | Critical | business.google.com |
| Bing Places | 95 | High | bingplaces.com |
| Yelp | 94 | High | biz.yelp.com |
| BBB | 93 | High | bbb.org |
| Facebook Business | 96 | High | business.facebook.com |
| Apple Maps | 100 | Medium | mapsconnect.apple.com |

**Critical rule:** Use EXACTLY the same business name, address, and phone number on every single listing. Inconsistent NAP data hurts local SEO.
